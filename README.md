# nsl-classification

The **Nepali Sign Language dataset** used here is created by me and my friends: **Saurav Bhandari, Sijan Bhattarai, and Birat Poudel.** Find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biratpoudelrocks/nepali-sign-language-character-dataset

Just a simple classification, not much work here though. The tfrecord.py creates Tensorflow Records from images, and the notebook trains the model using pretrained MobileNetV2 from Keras Application.
